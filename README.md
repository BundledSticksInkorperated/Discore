# [Discore](https://bundledsticksinkorperated.github.io/Discore/) v2
### _Discord + .NET Core = Discore_

There is a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Discore) package, install with `Install-Package Discore -Pre` from the Package Manager Console. 
The NuGet package is updated after each commit (suffixed with the SHA1 commit hash) so some things will change/break/explode without warning.

Discore is library written in pure [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) for creating various kinds of bots for the popular communications client [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)

Built out of curiosity and for personal use, released under the [MIT License](../blob/master/LICENSE.md).

Most of the public Classes/Methods are documented in source via XML comments. Eventually there will be proper documentation.
